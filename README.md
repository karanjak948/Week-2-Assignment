The code creates an empty list `my_list`, appends the elements 10, 20, 30, and 40, and then inserts the value 15 at the second position (index 1). It extends the list with additional elements `[50, 60, 70]`, removes the last element (70), and sorts the list in ascending order. Finally, it finds the index of the value 30 and prints this index, which shows the position of 30 in the sorted list.
